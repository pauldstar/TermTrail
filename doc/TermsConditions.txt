there are no refunds for buying another user's termtrail
this doesn't guarantee a great result, it just makes reading and remembering important parts of your course easier.
Buying a trail only gives you the right to read/write on your trail copy. but no "collaboration".
if buyer wants to sell a copy, then  the buyer keeps = (selling_price - commission)/trail_export_count. owners of origin trails get cuts.
buyer can't share a copy for free, unless selling price for origin trail is 0; must sell for atleast same price as origin trail.
