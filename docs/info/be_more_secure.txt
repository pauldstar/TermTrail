For the best security, both the system and any application folders should be placed above web root so that they are not directly accessible via a browser. By default, .htaccess files are included in each folder to help prevent direct access, but it is best to remove them from public access entirely in case the web server configuration changes or doesn’t abide by the .htaccess.

If you would like to keep your views public it is also possible to move the views folder out of your application folder.

After moving them, open your main index.php file and set the $system_path, $application_folder and $view_folder variables, preferably with a full path, e.g. ‘/www/MyUser/system‘.
